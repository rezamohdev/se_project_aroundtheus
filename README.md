**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Plan on improving the project**
We'll add more functionality to project next versions from different UI component to making our page from a simple static page to a fully functional and dynamic website.

Good luck and have fun!
